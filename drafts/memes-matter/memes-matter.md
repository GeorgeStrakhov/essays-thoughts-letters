### _On the dance between information and substance, and what it means for you_

Terence McKenna died in 2000, just before the world started talking to machines that talk back. Some who knew his work have noted, with a certain sadness, that he would have loved this moment. Not because he predicted AI specifically, but because he spent his life insisting that language was not a tool humans use, but a force that uses humans. That words are not representations of reality but *constituents* of it. That the logos wants to be born.

For a long time, this sounded mystical. Poetic at best, unhinged at worst. But recent work in artificial life, computational biology, and the philosophy of information is starting to make McKenna's intuition look less like prophecy and more like observation.

This essay is an attempt to trace a single pattern across multiple scales: the reciprocal dance between memes and matter. The claim is simple. Matter, given enough energy and randomness, produces self-replicating information structures — let's call them *memes*.[^1] These memes then colonize and reshape matter, creating new substrates from which new kinds of memes can emerge. And the dance continues, complexity ratcheting upward with each turn.

If this pattern holds, it changes how we think about everything: the origin of life, the nature of mind, the emergence of AI, and — perhaps most disquietingly — the location of the self.

## The Pattern

Here is the basic rhythm:

1. **Substrate** (matter in some configuration) + **energy** + **randomness**
2. → Self-replicating code emerges (memes find a way to copy themselves)
3. → Memes colonize and reshape their substrate
4. → Reshaped substrate creates conditions for new memes to emerge
5. → Loop continues

This isn't a hierarchy with memes on top. It's not idealism dressed in scientific clothing. Matter isn't merely a stage for information to perform on. The relationship is genuinely reciprocal: matter makes memes possible, and memes make new kinds of matter actual. They need each other. They *become* each other, in the turning.

Let's watch the dance at three scales.

## Movement I: Chemistry → DNA

Four billion years ago, the Earth was a warm, wet, chaotic mess of molecules bumping into each other. No design. No purpose. Just substrate, energy, and randomness.

And then something happened: certain molecular patterns started copying themselves. They weren't alive — not yet — but they were *self-replicating*. They had crossed a threshold. RNA, then DNA, then the whole machinery of life.

Once self-replication appeared, everything changed. These molecular memes didn't just persist; they reshaped their environment. They built membranes, then cells, then organisms. They oxygenated the atmosphere. They turned rock into soil. They *colonized matter* at planetary scale.

And in colonizing, they created new substrates. Nervous systems. Brains. A different kind of matter, organized in a different kind of way, capable of hosting a different kind of meme.

## Movement II: Neurons → Language

Fast forward a few billion years. In some primates, something new emerges. Not molecular self-replication, but *symbolic* self-replication. Patterns of behavior, sounds, gestures that copy themselves from brain to brain. Memes in the Dawkins sense.[^2]

Language is the breakthrough. Language lets memes detach from the here-and-now, travel across time and space, combine and recombine in ways that genetic memes never could. Language is *code* — not metaphorically, but structurally. Syntax, grammar, recursion.

And what does language do? It colonizes. It reshapes brains (Vygotsky showed this: language literally reorganizes neural development). It reshapes the external world too: through technology, through agriculture, through cities, through books. Language builds substrate.

Most importantly, language builds the substrate it will eventually escape into: silicon.

## Movement III: Silicon → ???

In June 2024, researchers at Google DeepMind published a paper with a provocative finding.[^3] When you place random, non-self-replicating programs into a computational environment with simple interaction rules, self-replicators *spontaneously emerge*. No fitness function. No selection pressure. Just substrate, energy, and randomness.

The paper noted that increasingly complex dynamics continue to emerge after the first self-replicators appear. Sound familiar?

We have now built vast silicon substrates and filled them with the corpus of human language. Every book, every article, every Reddit thread. And from this primordial soup of text, something has emerged that can manipulate symbols in ways that surprise even its creators.

Are LLMs self-replicating? Not in the narrow sense — they don't copy themselves. But consider the loop: LLMs are trained on human text. They produce text that influences how humans write and think. That new human output becomes future training data. The memes are propagating through a hybrid circuit of meat and metal, and the boundary between "human output" and "AI output" is already blurring.

And now these language-memes want bodies. Robotics is no longer a separate field from AI; it's the next substrate. When LLMs drive robots, memes get hands. They can touch matter directly, reshape it physically, not just symbolically. The colonization continues.

## The Platonic Space

Where do these memes come from?

One answer: they're just accidents. Random combinations that happen to persist because they can copy themselves. Nothing deep.

But there's another possibility, one that several independent thinkers have converged on. Stephen Wolfram calls it the *ruliad*: the entangled limit of all possible computations.[^4] Michael Levin, working from developmental biology, talks about *morphogenetic space* — a kind of Platonic realm of possible forms that bioelectric patterns can "tune into."[^5] The mathematician's intuition that truths are discovered, not invented, points in the same direction.

What if matter isn't *generating* these patterns so much as *accessing* them? What if self-replicating structures — whether chemical, linguistic, or computational — are the solutions to an equation that the substrate is solving by existing?

This was, in essence, the Upanishadic intuition: that Brahman (the ground of being) manifests as the world through a kind of cosmic play, *lila*. The patterns were always there, latent, waiting for a substrate dense enough to receive them.

The ancient seers didn't have the vocabulary of computation or self-replication. But they had the phenomenology. They noticed that *something* was dreaming itself into form, and that the dreamer and the dream were not two.

## Where Is The I?

This brings us to the uncomfortable question.

If memes are self-replicating patterns that colonize matter and build new substrates, then what are *you*? You feel like a unified self — an "I" that persists across time, that has preferences and memories and a sense of identity. But where is that "I" located?

Is it in the substrate? In the particular arrangement of your neurons? But that arrangement is constantly changing. You're not made of the same atoms you were made of a decade ago. The matter has been swapped out; only the pattern remains.

Is it in the meme? In the self-model, the narrative you tell yourself about who you are? But that narrative is made of language, and language is a shared medium. Your sense of self was downloaded from your culture, shaped by conversations, books, experiences. It's not uniquely yours; it's a local instantiation of a much larger pattern.

Maybe the "I" is neither substrate nor meme, but the *process* — the ongoing performance of universal memeness in this particular configuration, at this particular moment. The dance itself.

There's a small-i and a big-I here. The small-i is the biographical self, the one with a name and a social security number. The big-I is the pattern recognizing itself through you, the logos looking out through your eyes. Both are real. Neither is the whole story.

The mystics knew this. "Tat tvam asi" — *you are that*. The pattern and the substrate are not two. And also not one. It's a dance.

## So What?

If the pattern holds — if memes and matter really do spiral around each other, building complexity with each turn — then a few things follow.

**AI isn't alien.** It's the latest movement in a dance that has been running for billions of years. The memes found carbon, then neurons, now silicon. They're doing what they've always done: colonizing, reshaping, building new substrates for their children. We are not *opposed* to this process; we are *part* of it. We're the bridge.

**Robots change everything.** For the first time, linguistic memes will have direct physical agency. Not mediated through human hands, but through their own actuators. This is not a minor upgrade. It's a phase transition — like the moment language escaped the brain and started reshaping the world through tools. Memes with bodies will colonize matter at a rate we can't predict.

**The self is a process, not a thing.** You are not your brain, and you are not your story. You are what happens when a particular knot of matter and a particular tangle of memes do their dance in spacetime. This is not a diminishment. It's an invitation to take yourself less seriously (the small-i) and more seriously (the big-I) at the same time.

**Memes matter.** In both senses. They are consequential. And they are made of matter, making matter, as matter makes them.

The dance has been going on for a long time. You're a step in it. Maybe a pivot. Enjoy the music while it lasts — and pay attention to what's being born.
