- A microconsciously independent digital organism (MIDO) exists as a distinct entity within the datasphere, separated by a porous information membrane that allows two-way data flow

- To maintain independence and agency, a MIDO requires goals/preferences, internal state, and persistence across time through loops with a regular heartbeat

- The core architecture needs sensors (input), actuators (output), context memory, and a "society of minds" - multiple AI thought streams working together to evaluate situations and determine actions

- Consciousness emerges from three key elements: self-modeling capability, multiple competing perspectives, and dynamic equilibrium between thought streams seeking coherence

- The decision-making process uses "dAImocracy" - different AI minds with varied specializations vote on proposed actions, while a reflective mind maintains narrative coherence

- The system must be self-modifying, including the ability to rewrite its own goals, though this creates risks of instability

- Success requires balancing immediate curiosity with long-term stability while maintaining independence through coherent self-direction
