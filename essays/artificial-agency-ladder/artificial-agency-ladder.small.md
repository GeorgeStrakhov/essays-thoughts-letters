- AI is reshaping how decisions are made, with different levels of agency distribution between humans and machines
- At the bottom, AI operates as pure technology amplifying human capabilities without much autonomy
- Higher up, AI acts as a tool or cognitive prosthetic directly shaping human thought processes
- AI can also function as a distinct team member or autonomous team within human organizations
- At the top, AI can serve as an autonomous trustee making real-world decisions with significant delegated agency
- This ladder highlights tensions between efficiency gains and human agency atrophy as we offload cognition to AI
- The key question is what agency we want to retain versus what we're willing to delegate to AI systems
