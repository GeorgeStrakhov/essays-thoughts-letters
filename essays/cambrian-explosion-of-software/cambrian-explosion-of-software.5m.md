Five hundred and forty-one million years ago, a revolution swept across Earth. The sudden abundance of oxygen triggered an explosion of biological complexity, diversity and scale never seen before. Today, we're witnessing a similar revolution in the realm of software, driven by an analogous force: the sudden abundance of intelligence.

Just as the availability of oxygen transformed the game of life from mere survival to a complex dance of adaptation and specialization, the availability of intelligence is transforming software from a game of manual construction to one of purposeful evolution. When oxygen became abundant, life was no longer constrained by the basics of energy production in a hostile environment. Instead, organisms had to find their unique niches in an increasingly crowded and interconnected ecosystem. They had to become smarter, more adaptable, more strategic.

Similarly, as intelligence becomes abundant through large language models and other AI technologies, software is breaking free from the constraints of manual coding and deployment. The fundamental challenge is shifting from "how do we build this?" to "what should we build, and why?" In a world where construction becomes trivial, the real value lies in understanding context, anticipating change, and guiding evolution.

This transformation will unfold in two waves. First, software engineers will evolve into software architects and designers. Their primary value will come not from writing code, but from making strategic decisions about what to build and how systems should adapt over time. They'll be less like construction workers and more like city planners, thinking in terms of ecosystems rather than individual programs.

But that's just the beginning. As building software becomes even cheaper and faster, even architecture in the traditional sense will become secondary. When you can rapidly create and destroy software with minimal cost, the focus shifts from careful upfront design to guided evolution. The future belongs to software breeders and digital gardeners who will:

- Plant seeds of functionality and watch them grow
- Cross-pollinate successful systems to create new hybrids
- Prune away failed experiments
- Guide evolution toward aesthetic and functional goals
- Create fertile environments for beneficial mutations

Just as the Cambrian explosion led to an unprecedented diversity of life forms, this software explosion will lead to an explosion of digital organisms, each finding its niche in the expanding computational ecosystem. The winners won't be the most efficiently coded or perfectly architected systems, but those that best adapt to their environment and fulfill genuine needs.

We're entering an era where software isn't engineered - it's cultivated. The question isn't "How do we build the perfect system?" but rather "How do we create conditions for beneficial evolution?" This shift from construction to cultivation will fundamentally transform how we create and interact with technology, ushering in an age of digital biodiversity we can barely imagine today.
