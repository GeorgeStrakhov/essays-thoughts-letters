Life finds a way. And so does code.

541 million years ago, Earth experienced an explosion of biological diversity. The trigger? Oxygen became abundant, enabling more complex and interconnected forms of life to emerge in radical new quantities. What was once a simple game of survival became an intricate dance of adaptation and specialization.

Today, we're witnessing a similar explosion – but this time in software. The catalyst isn't oxygen, but intelligence. As AI makes the basic ingredients of software creation abundant, we're entering an era where building things is no longer the challenge. The real game is figuring out what to build.

Think about those early cells. When resources became plentiful, success wasn't just about basic replication anymore. It became about finding the right niche in an increasingly crowded ecosystem. About developing unique strategies. About becoming smarter.

Software is following the same evolutionary path. In a world where code can essentially write itself, the value shifts from implementation to intention. The question isn't "How do we build this?" but "What should we build, and why?"

This transformation will happen in waves. First, software engineers will evolve into architects and designers. Their focus will shift from writing code to making higher-level decisions about structure and purpose. They'll need to think more about adaptability and less about immediate functionality.

But that's just the beginning. As building becomes even cheaper and easier, even architecture will take a back seat. Why carefully design every detail when you can rapidly prototype, test, and let natural selection do its work? The future belongs to software gardeners – people who guide digital evolution rather than controlling every line of code.

These gardeners will plant seeds of functionality, nurture promising mutations, and prune dead ends. They'll create conditions for useful features to emerge and spread. Like early Earth's explosion of life, we'll see an explosion of software diversity – some of it beautiful, some strange, all of it evolving.

The tools for writing software are becoming as abundant as oxygen was to early life. And just as that abundance transformed simple cells into the rich tapestry of life we see today, it will transform software from something we meticulously craft into something we cultivate and grow.

The question isn't whether this transformation will happen, but how we'll adapt to our new role as gardeners in this digital ecosystem. The future belongs not to those who can write the cleanest code, but to those who can best guide its evolution.
