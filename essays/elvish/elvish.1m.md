- Two magics: "Human" (power, control) & "Elvish" (understanding, harmony).
- "Human" magic (technology) seeks world-amputation, minimizing dependence, but destroys the world.
- "Elvish" magic seeks self-amputation, maximizing understanding, becoming one with the world.
- Mortals pursue power over death, creating more death. Immortals pursue understanding, dissolving the self.
- For Humans, advanced tech is magic; for Elves, it's nature. Elves let nature do its magic.
- Rebalance magic: "Elvish" questions help reframe problems, resources become agents, information is an output.
- Shift to "Elvish" tech: outcome is a process, resources are agents, information is an output.
- Reimagining magic is needed, or we'll face world-amputation.
- As we evolve, our magic must too.
- The first step to immortality is acting as if we already were.
