In 1776, a group of rebellious colonists declared their independence from the British crown. Today, we need the opposite: a declaration of interdependence. Not because independence was wrong, but because we've taken it too far. We've built our entire civilization on the myth of the self-sufficient individual, the self-made success, the lone genius. But this myth is crumbling before our eyes.

## The Great Unraveling

I first noticed this shift while watching my nephew learn to code. He wasn't really learning to code in the traditional sense - he was learning to collaborate with AI, to prompt and guide and refine. His relationship with technology wasn't one of mastery, but of partnership. He wasn't declaring independence from human teachers - he was declaring interdependence with artificial ones.

This is not just about coding or AI. Look around and you'll see the myth of independence dissolving everywhere:

- The "self-made" entrepreneur turns out to be deeply embedded in networks of customers, suppliers, algorithms, and platforms
- The "independent" researcher relies on vast databases, search engines, and collaborative tools
- The "sovereign" nation discovers it can't tackle climate change or regulate AI without unprecedented international cooperation

We're witnessing the great unraveling of the independence myth. But what's emerging in its place?

## The Web of Life (and Death)

Consider a tree in an ancient forest. At first glance, it appears to stand alone - proud, independent, self-sufficient. But look closer and you'll see it's actually a hub in a vast network: its roots intertwined with fungal networks that connect it to other trees, its branches hosting countless species, its very existence dependent on and contributing to the entire ecosystem.

We humans are no different. Every breath we take connects us to the plants that produce oxygen. Every thought we think is shaped by the languages and concepts we inherited. Every action we take ripples through the complex web of social, technological, and ecological relationships we inhabit.

Even death, that most seemingly individual of experiences, is profoundly collective. When we die, our atoms don't disappear - they rejoin the great dance of matter and energy that makes up our world. Our ideas don't vanish - they live on in the minds we touched, the systems we built, the changes we helped create.

## The Technology of Together

Our technology is evolving to reflect this reality. The internet itself is a declaration of interdependence - a vast system that only works because millions of devices agree to speak the same protocols, share the same standards, play by the same rules.

Social media, for all its flaws, makes visible the networks of connection that have always existed between us. Blockchain technology is essentially a way to encode trust and interdependence into our financial and social systems. And AI, perhaps most profoundly, is teaching us that intelligence itself is not a solitary achievement but a collaborative emergence.

The most exciting technologies being developed today are not tools of independence but platforms of interdependence:

- Collaborative filtering systems that help us find what we need by learning from each other's choices
- Open source projects that thrive on mutual aid and shared creation
- Decentralized networks that derive their strength from distribution rather than concentration

## The Price of Connection

But let's not romanticize interdependence. Like any fundamental truth, it comes with costs and complications. Being interdependent means being vulnerable. It means accepting that we can't control everything, that our fate is tied to others, that our security lies not in walls but in webs.

This is scary stuff. No wonder we cling to the myth of independence. No wonder we elect leaders who promise to make us great again by making us separate again. No wonder we dream of escaping to Mars rather than fixing Earth.

But the cost of pretending to be independent is even higher. It leads us to ignore systemic risks until they become catastrophes. It prevents us from building the collaborative institutions we need to tackle global challenges. It blinds us to both the responsibilities and opportunities that come with being part of something larger than ourselves.

## A New Declaration

What would a declaration of interdependence look like? Not a rejection of individual rights and responsibilities, but a recognition that these only make sense within a broader web of relationships and obligations. Not a surrender of personal agency, but an acknowledgment that true power comes from connection rather than separation.

Such a declaration might start: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all beings are interconnected, that our fates are intertwined, that our rights and responsibilities flow from our relationships rather than existing in isolation..."

But perhaps we don't need to write this declaration. Perhaps we just need to open our eyes and see that it's already written - in the protocols that govern our internet, in the ecosystems that sustain our planet, in the neural networks that increasingly augment our minds, and in the ancient wisdom that reminds us we were never really separate in the first place.

The question isn't whether to declare our interdependence - reality has already done that for us. The question is whether we'll have the wisdom to embrace it, and the courage to build a world that reflects it.
