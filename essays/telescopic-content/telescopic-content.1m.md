*   Telescopic writing scales with attention, like Chris Alexander's "A city is not a tree" â€“ powerful as a slogan or essay.

*   It demands core arguments, like Picasso's bull, offering clarity and "stickiness" through author-compressed thought.

*   Reading, too, can be telescopic: skim headlines, then dive in, or use LLMs to summarize.

*   LLMs make content telescopic by default, aiding distillation but risking "tiktokification" of content.

*   As writers, we must embrace this, designing telescopically.

*   My essays are now telescopic by design, scaling to your chosen attention level.

*   It doesn't always work. But when it does - it's feels great.
