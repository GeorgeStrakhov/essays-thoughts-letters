I find the best non-fiction writing to be fractal, or [telescopic](https://telescopictext.org). It scales nicely with the amount of attention that you decide to bestow on it, and still makes sense and is tightly packed at every scale.

Christopher Alexander's ["A city is not a tree"](https://bp.ntu.edu.tw/001/Upload/1352/ckfile/176357fb-2068-4e40-8c50-593780261ce7.pdf) is a great example of that. It works at a slogan level. Just the title itself in 6 words outlines the key idea. And yet - at the essay level it works too and is not just a lot of extra words without much extra signal. I can also imagine that if Christopher Alexander wrote a book-length exposition - it would still be powerful in its own right. Without feeling like a "a book that could have been a blogpost".

Writing telescopically is difficult. It pushes you to get to the core of your argument in a similar way that Picasso's famous [bull exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Taureau) did. What are the key lines that make this bull really what it is?

One of the benefits of writing telescopically is clarity. But the other is - stickiness. Because the author goes through the work of compressing and decompressing the thought, the reader has it easier. They don't have to invent their own shorthands and heuristics. The author has already provided them.

Reading can also be telescopic for example, when you skim over a page and pick out the headlines - before diving in. Or when you ask an LLM to summarize the content for you. That is the shrinking part of it. But you can also expand: when you read commentaries to the original text. Or if you search for other references from footnotes.

In the age of LLMs, all content can be telescopic by default and for free. They can shrink and expand any text as you wish. The upside is obvious: the intentionality of attention that you are willing to give as a reader, and the assistance that you get as a writer in distilling and expanding. But there are downsides as well. Namely, because the attention that you are using to shrink or expand is not exactly yours - there is a real danger of enshittification and tiktokification of content becoming a new norm. And once our tools shape our taste (and our attention spans) - there is no going back.

Still, the genie is out of the box. Someone somewhere must have made a browser plugin that makes any content you land on shrink or expand to taste. All content is telescopic by default - whether you as a writer want that or not. So I feel like the only option we have as writers - is to embrace this. And build telescopic by design.

That's what I'm trying to do here. This essay, as well as all other essays on this platform - are from now on telescopic. You can decide how much attention you are going to give them. And they scale accordingly.

From the technology standpoint, building it was not hard, but there were a few interesting choices. For example, how do I make sure that the generated alternative still sounds as much like me as possible? For now it's just careful prompting and supplying all the examples to a large context window model along the task.

Another interesting challenge was UX - how do we present the different "zoom" levels. And how do we show to the user the "natural", default one - how it was written originally vs. extra ones. Also as a writer - I want to have a way of "approving" a summarized or expanded version - then it becomes "official" (as indiciated by a green dot). For now the way this works is - when a new version is autogenerated - I receive an email with this new version. I can then edit it, add it to the repo and redeploy. And now this version will have a green dot, signifying that this has been human-approved.

Should you be interested, you can see the implementation [on github](https://github.com/GeorgeStrakhov/essays-thoughts-letters). It's all very basic and mostly written by Claude for me with some guidance. But it works to some degree.

The most joyful moments of all of this for me as a writer were when I got an expanded version of something - and it had new and powerful ideas or parallels that I haven't seen myself. That was absolutely magical and felt like free lunch. Because it sort of was, I guess. Is it less valuable as a result? Does the amount of work put in somehow make the output more valuable? I am not sure about this yet. Most of the time I end up rewriting pretty much everything that LLMs write for me. But there are words, sentences, sometimes even full paragraphs that are starting to stick.

Most people would find this scary. And it doesn't work well just yet. But when it does - it's not scary at all. It feels great.
