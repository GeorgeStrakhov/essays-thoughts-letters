*   Telescopic writing scales with attention, like Christopher Alexander's "A city is not a tree" â€“ powerful as a slogan or essay.

*   It demands core arguments, like Picasso's bull, offering clarity and also "stickiness" through author-compressed thought, free heuristics that the reader can readily apply.

*   Reading, too, can be telescopic: skim headlines, then dive in, or use LLMs to summarize, or expand to explain.

*   LLMs make content telescopic by default, aiding distillation but risking "enshittification" and "tiktokification" of content, because the attention used to generate alternative versions is not the same as the attention used to read the content.

*   As writers, we have no choice but to embrace this, designing telescopically from the start.

*   My essays are now telescopic by design, scaling to your chosen attention level.

*   It doesn't always work. But when it does - it's magical.

*   If you take this to its logical conclusion - you can generate an essay just from the title. So all content is infinite.

*   No more 404 pages. Try it out. Put any essay title after the slash.

*   It's time someone builds a blogging platform that is built for the world of infinite telescopic content.
