* True creativity isn't about building, but about birthing - nurturing ideas into existence rather than forcing them into shape

* The role of a creative midwife is to let go of control and allow ideas to emerge naturally, following their own path rather than our rigid plans

* Like a sculptor working with marble, we must listen to the inherent qualities of our creative material rather than imposing our will upon it

* Creating fertile ground means cultivating curiosity, playfulness and openness to the unexpected - keeping our hook in the water whether fish are biting or not

* The midwife's role is about trust and confidence in the process, being present and attentive while allowing the idea to follow its own intelligence

* In our algorithmic age, creative midwifery offers a way to work with technology rather than being controlled by it, bringing forth new possibilities through humble receptivity
