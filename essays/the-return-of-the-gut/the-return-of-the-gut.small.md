* 150,000 years ago, our common grandmother started trusting the voices in her head over her gut instincts, passing this trait to all humanity

* For millennia, we believed these internal voices of rationality were special and trustworthy, giving us exclusive rights to "reason" and "truth"

* Today, AI language models are exposing the emptiness of this belief - they can generate equally convincing rational arguments for anything

* Our monopoly on reasoning is broken, forcing us to confront an uncomfortable choice: return to trusting our guts, or upgrade to artificial voices

* After 150,000 years of living in our heads, we face a pivotal moment: will AI enslave us further to rationalization, or paradoxically free us to return to our natural instincts?

* The breakdown of our ancestral "madness" could be either our undoing or our salvation - only time will tell which path humanity chooses
