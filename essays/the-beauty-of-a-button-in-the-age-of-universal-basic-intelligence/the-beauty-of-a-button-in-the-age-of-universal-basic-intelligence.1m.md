- In an age of AI and automation, the humble button represents humanity's last stand for direct, unmediated control

- Unlike voice commands or AI interfaces that negotiate and suggest, buttons offer binary, decisive action - press or don't press

- Buttons persist in critical systems (cockpits, emergency rooms) because they provide absolute clarity of intention without ambiguity

- The physical ritual of pressing a button creates micro-moments of intentional engagement with our tools, like winding a mechanical watch

- Buttons serve as psychological anchors of human agency - their constraints and simplicity offer relief from endless AI optimization

- As we move deeper into automation, buttons won't disappear but evolve into more ceremonial interfaces that celebrate human choice

- The beauty of buttons lies not in sophistication but in honest simplicity - they do exactly what we tell them, nothing more or less
