Newton gave us laws for objects. But what about the objects that own us? Here are the three iron laws of consumerism – as reliable as gravity, as inescapable as entropy, shaping our economic destinies whether we notice them or not.

The First Law of Consumerism hits you like a ton of bricks: everything you buy regularly today, you will keep buying indefinitely, unless an external force acts upon you. That morning coffee? Motion in perpetuity. Those streaming subscriptions? Inertia made manifest. Your branded sneakers? Pure momentum, baby. These aren't just purchases – they're grooves in spacetime, carrying you forward until something dramatic smashes your patterns to pieces.

The Second Law of Consumerism is where things get deliciously perverse: your likelihood of buying more things is proportional to your subjective unhappiness times your disposable income. Force equals mass times acceleration? Try consumption equals discontent times cash. The unhappy rich person becomes the perfect consumer, their wealth and misery multiplying in an endless dance of acquisition. Ka-ching!

The Third Law of Consumerism is the kicker: whatever you think you own also owns you in an equal and opposite way. That shiny new phone? It owns your attention. That bigger house? It owns your weekends. Even your "simple" t-shirt collection owns your closet space, your laundry time, your decision-making bandwidth. For every act of ownership, there is an equal reaction of being owned. It's poetry in motion, folks.

This mutual ownership goes deeper than mere maintenance. Your possessions are puppet masters, pulling strings you didn't even know you had. The expensive car pushes you toward soul-crushing jobs. The fancy wardrobe whispers about which parties you "should" attend. The smart home gadgets reprogram your behaviors like you're some kind of fancy lab rat.

Can we escape these laws? About as easily as you can escape gravity. But here's the twist: just as engineers use Newton's laws to build aircraft that give gravity the middle finger, we can use our understanding of consumerism's laws to make more conscious choices. The most valuable possessions often demand the most from us – think of that dusty guitar demanding to be played, that yoga mat crying for attention, that half-read book judging you from the nightstand. But their demands can be the very forces that launch us into orbit.

The real game is choosing your puppet masters wisely. Wouldn't it be better if before each purchase, we could ask ourselves:

- Am I ready for this consumption pattern to become my new normal?
- Is my dissatisfaction driving me toward meaningful growth or just more elaborate chains?
- Am I willing to be owned by this object as much as it will likely own me?
