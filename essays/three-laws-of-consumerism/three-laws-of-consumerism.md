# Three Laws of Consumerism

1. Everything that you buy regularly today, you will keep buying indefinitely, unless an external force acts upon you.

2. Your likelihood of buying more things is proportional to your subjective unhappiness times your disposable income.

3. Whatever you think you own also owns you in an equal way.
