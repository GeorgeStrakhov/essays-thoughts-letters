The seemingly random string of nonsense words that we instinctively dismiss could be the key to understanding where human language ends and machine language begins. I've been thinking about this a lot lately, as I watch my young nephew explore the boundaries of meaningful speech through playful babbling and made-up words.

## The Joy of Nonsense

There's something deeply human about stringing together sounds that have no meaning just because they feel good to say. "Yak yak shmuk fuck" rolls off the tongue with a percussive rhythm, each syllable bouncing into the next like stones skipping across a pond. It's pure sound-play, freed from the burden of having to mean anything.

This is precisely the kind of language that our AI models struggle with. They can generate grammatically perfect sentences and even mimic different writing styles, but they fundamentally operate on pattern recognition and statistical relationships. There's no joy in their language, no playful exploration of sound for sound's sake.

## The Space Between Meaning

When we say nonsense words, we're operating in a fascinating liminal space between pure sound and structured meaning. It's like jazz musicians playing with dissonance - the notes don't follow conventional harmony, but they create something meaningful through their very rejection of traditional meaning.

I'm reminded of Lewis Carroll's "Jabberwocky" - a poem that manages to tell a clear story despite being filled with made-up words. We understand "brillig" and "slithy toves" not through their dictionary definitions, but through their sound, their placement, their feeling. This is a uniquely human capability: finding meaning in meaninglessness.

## Digital Dadaism 

Perhaps what we need in our increasingly AI-mediated world is a new wave of digital dadaism - an intentional embrace of the nonsensical as a way to reclaim our human relationship with language. While machines get better at generating coherent text, we could focus on generating beautiful incoherence.

Think about it: "yak yak shmuk fuck" could never be generated by an AI trying to be helpful or informative. It comes from a place of pure play, of testing boundaries, of exploring what happens when we temporarily suspend our need for meaning. It's a tiny act of rebellion against the tyranny of sense-making.

## The Future of Nonsense

As our interactions become increasingly mediated by AI language models, maintaining our capacity for joyful nonsense becomes more important than ever. It's not just about being silly - it's about preserving a uniquely human way of relating to language and meaning.

Maybe the real test of artificial intelligence shouldn't be whether a machine can pass as human in conversation, but whether it can appreciate the beauty of "yak yak shmuk fuck." Can it understand why sometimes we need words that mean nothing except the joy of saying them?

I suspect not. And perhaps that's exactly why we need to keep saying them.
